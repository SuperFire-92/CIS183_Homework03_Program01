 CRUD Database App

Program 01:
Upon opening the app, the admin is met with their list of employees and an add employee button. The add employee
button allows the admin to add an employee with a first name, last name, username, email, password, and age.
Once they add that user, they can return to the home screen and see that new employee in their list. If they
click on any employee in the list, they can see all of the detail of that employee in a new screen. In that screen,
they can also press the update button to move to the update employee screen. From here, they can update any detail
of the user except their username. All of this data is stored in an SQLite Database.
